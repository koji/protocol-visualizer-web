# Protocol Visualizer VSCode Extension

A VSCode extension (prototype) for simulating Opentrons Python protocols directly in VSCode and visualizing and inspecting the state of the Deck (work surface) and liquid volume changes in real time through a Webview panel.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

The following are required to use the extension:

- **Python 3.8 or later** must be installed, and the `python3` command must be available in PATH
- The **`opentrons`** Python package must be installed  

```bash
pip install opentrons
```

If you need to use this extension with an OT-2, you will need to install opentrons v9.0.0 or previous versions since v9.1.0+ does not support OT-2.

```bash
pip install opentrons==9.0.0
```

If you want to use this extension with Flex and OT-2, you will need to create a virtual environment and install opentrons packages separately. Then switch an environment on VSCode's Python Interpreter via `Command Palette`.

### Create a Virtual Environments
The following uses `python3` to create virtual environments because it does not require to install any packages or software. You can use any virtual environment manager you prefer such as `conda` or `uv`.

```bash
python3 -m venv .Flex
source .Flex/bin/activate
pip install opentrons
```

```bash
python3 -m venv .OT2
source .OT2/bin/activate
pip install opentrons
```

## 2. Usage
1. Open an Opentrons protocol `.py` file in VSCode.
2. Start Protocol Visualizer. Currently, there are 3 ways to start it:
 1. From the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`), run **`Opentrons: Open Protocol Visualizer`**.
 2. Click the **beaker** icon in the status bar.
 3. Set a new shortcut via Command Pallets `Open Keyboard Shortcuts` and start it with your custom shortcut.
3. When the Visualizer panel opens on the right side of the screen, and `If your protocol uses Runtime parameters`, Protocol Visualizer will generate UI inputs for these parameters.


`Once the analysis is complete, you are ready to edit your protocol.`

### 2-1 Custom labware
This extension supports custom labware definitions. You need to place your custom labware definition files in the same directory as your protocol file.

### 2-2 Auto-analysis
Protocol Visualizer starts analysis automatically when you save changes to your protocol file.

### 2-3 Pop out button
This extension is using VSCode's Auxiliary Window, so you can pop out the Visualizer panel to a separate window. Also you can do the same thing with dragging the Protocol Visualizer tab to somewhere of your screen.

### 2-4 Runtime parameters
For Runtime parameters, you will need to click `Analyze` button to apply your changes to your protocol. `If you change a Runtime parameter, Protocol Visualizer will not change your protocol.`
Runtime parameters function creates a temporary protocol file that applyes your changes as a default parameter value for the analysis and it will be removed whne the visualization is done.

### 2-5 Step Jumper
The step jumper that is located under `Protocol Steps` allows you to jump to a specific step in your protocol. Input the step number and hit `Enter` to jump to that step.
